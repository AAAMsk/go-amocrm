![amoCRM API Library](.github/amo-logo.png?raw=true)

**go-amocrm** is a Rest API for amoCRM and Kommo. You can manage
your application with this library. It contains almost every
API request amocrm provides with support of CRUD operations.

## Quick Start / Installation

To get started with **go-amocrm**, you'll need to do the following:

- Install the latest version of Go.
- Install the **go-amocrm** package using go get.
- Use the **go-amocrm** package in your Go code.
- Here's an example of how to install the package:

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-amocrm
```

## Models

**go-amocrm** includes a package for working with models, which allows you to use just the API and **create your own models**.
This means you can create your own structs and use them with our **go-amocrm** package, 
even if you don't want to use every field from amoCRM's entities.

Here's the link to [Models](https://github.com/whatcrm/go-amocrm/models) package and example of how to install the package.

```
go get github.com/whatcrm/go-amocrm/models
```
